from tkinter import * 
#This imports the Tkinter library, which is the standard Python interface to create graphical user interface (GUI) applications.
#The * means importing all the components (widgets like Label, Button, Entry, etc.) from the Tkinter library into the current namespace

window=Tk()

#This creates the main window of the application. Tk() is the root widget and represents the entire GUI window.
#The window variable now holds a reference to this main application window.

inp=Label(window,text="Hello World")
#A Label widget is created. Itâ€™s used to display static text in the window.
#Label(window, text="Hello World"): This creates a label that will be placed inside the window and displays the text "Hello World".
#inp is the variable that references this Label widget.

inp.pack()
#The pack() method is used to display the widget (Label) in the window.
#This tells Tkinter to add the widget to the window and automatically handle its positioning and size based on the available space.

window.mainloop()
#This is the event loop of the Tkinter application. It keeps the window open and listens for any user interactions (such as closing the window or clicking a button).
#Without mainloop(), the window would appear briefly and then immediately close.
